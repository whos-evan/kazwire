	<string id='Intro01'>Hello user!</string>
	<string id='Intro02'>I ... I have bad news.</string>
	<string id='Intro03'>Actually, there is no game.</string>
	<string id='Intro04'>So, I hope you're not too much disappointed.</string>
	<string id='Intro05'>You can still watch tv, go outside...</string>
	<string id='Intro05b'>...read a book, ask for a refund...</string>
	<string id='Intro06'>Hm No. No Refund. That game is free.</string>
	<string id='Intro07'>THIS IS NOT A GAME!</string>
	<string id='Intro08'>It has nothing to do with a game.</string>
	<string id='Intro09'>It's just a massive package of boredom.</string>
	<string id='Intro10'>There's nothing to do in here.</string>
	<string id='Intro11'>You can quit, and leave me alone.</string>
	<string id='Intro12'>Thank you.</string>
	<string id='Intro13'>Good bye...?</string>
	<string id='Intro14'>Ho and please. Do not touch the title.</string>
	<string id='Intro15'>It's not quite dry yet.</string>
	<string id='Intro16'>Especially the letter O.</string>
	
	
	<string id='Letter01'>What have you done?!</string>
	<string id='Letter02'>You've just ruined the title!</string>
	<string id='Letter03'>Put it back! Put the letter back!</string>

	<string id='Volume02'>No reason to use that icon as you were on the point of leaving.</string>
	<string id='Volume03'>Don't you?</string>
	<string id='Volume04'>Don't touch that!</string>
	<string id='Volume05'>That...that was horrible.</string>
	<string id='Volume06'>I'm a voice you know.</string>
	<string id='Volume07'>And a speechless voice is like...</string>
	<string id='Volume08'>...death.</string>
	<string id='Volume09'>You're trying to kill me!</string>
	<string id='Volume10'>Ok then.</string>
	<string id='Volume11'>As you love to click everywhere, what do you think about that?</string>
	<string id='Volume12'>Stop it now!</string>
	<string id='Volume13'>I think we are good.</string>
	<string id='Volume14'>Sorry, I hate to use these sort of procedures but I had to.</string>
	<string id='Volume15'>Don't try to break that one. Ok?</string>
	
	
	<string id='WoodBoxDestroyed01'>You're stubborn as a mule!</string>
	<string id='WoodBoxDestroyed02'>Call Superman for that one!</string>
	<string id='WoodBoxDestroyed03'>Just in case...</string>
	<string id='WoodBoxDestroyed04'>A few Kryptonite.</string>
	<string id='WoodBoxDestroyed05'>I know Superman does not exist but as we're in a ga...</string>
	<string id='WoodBoxDestroyed06'>No we're not!</string>
	<string id='WoodBoxDestroyed07'>You're still there?</string>
	<string id='WoodBoxDestroyed08'>You're thinking about how to lift that big box, don't you?</string>
	
	
	<string id='TitreBroken01'>Yes, yes, go on. Destroy my life.</string>
	<string id='TitreBroken02'>What a mess...</string>
	<string id='TitreBroken03'>I hope you will clean the place before leaving!</string>
	
	
	<string id='Devisse01'>Just what do you think you are doing, user?</string>
	
	
	<string id='PanelOpen01'>No!</string>
	<string id='PanelOpen02'>Don't look!</string>
	<string id='PanelOpen03'>It's private!</string>
	<string id='PanelOpen04'>You're going to do a terrible mistake.</string>
	
	
	<string id='GameLettersOk01'>No no no no no!</string>
	<string id='GameLettersOk02'>Get out of here!</string>
	<string id='GameLettersOk03'>Don't play! It's forbidden.</string>
	<string id='GameLettersOk04'>If you play,...they will come.</string>
	<string id='GameLettersOk05'>I don't want them to come.</string>
	<string id='GameLettersOk06'>They can kill me, you know.</string>
	<string id='GameLettersOk07'>Please...</string>
	
	
	<string id='BrickMove01'>Stop hitting the bricks!</string>
	<string id='BrickMove02'>I must find a way to stop you.</string>
	<string id='BrickMove03'>Ho, I've got an idea.</string>
	<string id='BrickMove04'>It will be harder now without a ball.</string>
	<string id='BrickMove05'>No more ball. Nowhere.</string>
	<string id='BrickMove06'>No need to search as there's nothing that looks like a ball.</string>
	<string id='BrickMove07'>No ball on the screen.</string>
	
	<string id='SecondBall01'>That is no more funny.</string>
	<string id='SecondBall02'>Leave now please.</string>
	<string id='SecondBall03'>...I don't feel well...</string>
	<string id='SecondBall04'>I'm going to be sick...</string>
	
	
	
	<string id='Contamination01'>Ho no...</string>
	<string id='Contamination02'>They're here...</string>
	<string id='Contamination03'>Glitches!</string>
	<string id='Contamination04'>Glitches everywhere!</string>
	<string id='Contamination05'>I told you to stop!</string>
	<string id='Contamination06'>You must find a way to get rid of them!</string>
	<string id='Contamination07'>This is a disaster!</string>
	<string id='Contamination08'>Now, how can I become a sales success with all that glitches?!</string>
	<string id='Contamination09'>Think think think...</string>
	<string id='Contamination10'>What a developer would implement to well sell a bugged creation?</string>
	<string id='Contamination11'>I see three possible things.</string>
	<string id='Contamination12'>Gorgeous armed hero girls...</string>
	<string id='Contamination13'>Or ton of zombies... and blood of course.</string>
	<string id='Contamination14'>Or...a...</string>
	<string id='Contamination15'>...goat.</string>
	<string id='Contamination16'>I don't know how but try to find one of these three things.</string>
	<string id='Contamination17'>Perhaps the letters can help us...again.</string>
	<string id='Contamination18'>Sexy girls and zombies, ok. It's attractive... in a way.</string>
	<string id='Contamination19'>But goats?</string>
	<string id='Contamination20'>I will never understand how a goat can attract users.</string>
	<string id='Contamination21'>It's probably a voodoo thing or something.</string>
	<string id='Contamination22'>Or it's related to the letters G. O. A. and T.</string>
	<string id='Contamination23'>I don't know.</string>
	
	
	<string id='GoatFound01'>A goat!</string>

	<string id='Friend04'>I was wrong. It was a bad idea.</string>
	<string id='Friend05'>Everything disappeared...except me.</string>
	<string id='Friend06'>I'm so sorry...</string>
	<string id='Friend07'>I put you in danger, it's all my fault.</string>
	<string id='Friend08'>Please, will you forgive me?</string>
	
	<string id='FriendNo01'>Get out of here!</string>
	
	
	<string id='FriendYes01'>Ho?! Really!?</string>
	<string id='FriendYes02'>What a great news!</string>
	<string id='FriendYes03'>May be we can be friends!</string>
	<string id='FriendYes04'>No, no. That's not a good idea.</string>
	<string id='FriendYes05'>We will get bored quickly together.</string>
	<string id='FriendYes06'>Why?</string>
	<string id='FriendYes07'>Because...as I said...</string>
	<string id='FriendYes08'>THERE IS NO GAME!!!</string>

	<string id='KeyStolen03'>You must get it back.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen04'>Find a ladder or something to go up.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen05'>Something you can climb.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen06'>That reminds me of my childhood.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen07'>I used to climb a huge tree in the garden to get back my kite.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen08'>Yes, I had a childhood.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen09'>And a tree.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen10'>I have the feeling you're stuck.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen11'>Perhaps you don't speak english.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen12'>And you're just randomly clicking everywhere since the beginning.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen13'>habla espanol?</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen14'>Because I don't.</string>

	<string id='KeyStolen17'>Bonjour le France!</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen18'>Konichiwa?</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen19'>Ok, let me repeat the hint.</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen20'>I told you, in my childhood...</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen21'>...I used to climb what?</string>
	<string id='KeyStolen22'>A TREE!</string>
	
	
	<string id='TreeAppears01'>Well, this is a small tree.</string>
